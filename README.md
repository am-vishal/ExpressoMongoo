# Git reset --soft and Git reset --hard

Let's say you have the following commit history:

```bash
A - B - C (master)
```

You're currently on the `master` branch, which is pointing to the latest commit `C`. You realize that you made a mistake in commit `B`, and you want to undo that change.

## Git reset --soft

To undo the change in commit `B` using `git reset --soft`, you would run the following command:

```bash
git reset --soft B
```

This moves the master branch pointer to commit B, and sets the staging area and the working directory to be the same as they were when you made commit B. This means that the changes from commit C are still present in the staging area and the working directory, and you can review them and re-commit them as needed.

```
A - B - C (master)
    â†‘
   HEAD
```

To commit the changes from commit C, you would use git commit:

```bash
 git commit -m "Commit message"
```

This creates a new commit that contains the changes from commit C, and updates the master branch pointer to point to the new commit:

```
A - B - C (origin)
    \
     C' (master)
```

Note that `C'` is a new commit with a different commit ID than `C`, because it contains a different history of changes.

## Git reset --hard

To undo the change in commit `B` using `git reset --hard`, you would run the following command:

```bash
 git reset --hard B
```

This moves the `master` branch pointer to commit `B`, and discards any changes in the staging area and the working directory that were made after commit `B`. This means that the changes from commit `C` are permanently lost.

```bash
A - B (master)
    \
     C
```

In this case, the commit `C` is still present in the repository's history, but it's no longer part of the `master` branch. If you want to access the changes from commit `C`, you can check out the commit ID directly, or create a new branch that starts at commit `C`.

## Git Merge vs Git Rebase

### Git Merge

`git merge` is used to combine changes from different branches into one. It creates a new merge commit to represent the resulting merge of the branches. The resulting commit history looks like a tree with multiple branches.

Here's an example of a `git merge`:

![Git Merge Example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*y3KlcxesRD59ra55.png)

In this example, we have a `feature` branch and a `master` branch. We want to merge the changes from the `feature` branch into the `master` branch. We run the following commands:

```bash
git checkout master
```

```bash
git merge feature
```

This creates a new merge commit on the `master` branch that represents the merge of the two branches.

### Git Rebase

`git rebase` is used to reapply commits on top of another branch. It creates a linear commit history without any merge commits. It's useful when you want to integrate changes from one branch into another, but you don't want to create a merge commit.

Here's an example of a `git rebase`:

![Git Rebase Example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*4uWRc1Rt-F2vc_vH.png)

In this example, we have a `feature` branch and a `master` branch. We want to reapply the changes from the `feature` branch on top of the `master` branch. We run the following commands:

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase master
```

This applies the changes from the `feature` branch on top of the `master` branch, creating a new linear commit history.

### Summary

In summary, `git merge` combines changes from different branches and creates a new merge commit, while `git rebase` re-applies commits on top of another branch and creates a linear commit history without merge commits. Choose the method that best fits your workflow and project needs.

## Git Cherry-Pick

`git cherry-pick` is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It allows you to pick and choose specific commits to apply to a different branch.

Here's an example of a `git cherry-pick`:

In this example, we have a `feature` branch and a `master` branch. We want to apply a specific commit (`Commit C`) from the `feature` branch to the `master` branch. We run the following commands:

```bash
git checkout master
git cherry-pick <Commit C>
```

This applies the changes made in `Commit C` from the `feature` branch to the `master` branch, creating a new commit (`Commit C'`) with the same changes on the `master` branch.

`git cherry-pick` is useful when you want to selectively apply changes from one branch to another. However, you should be careful when using `git cherry-pick`, especially if the commit you're cherry-picking has dependencies on other commits that are not present in the target branch.

### Summary

In summary, `git cherry-pick` allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. Use it when you want to selectively apply changes from one branch to another, but be careful when cherry-picking commits with dependencies on other commits.

## Git Bisect

Git bisect is a tool that helps you find the commit that introduced a bug or a regression in your code.

To start bisecting, run `git bisect start` in your terminal. Then, mark the current commit as good or bad using `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad`. Git will then check out the middle commit between the two and ask you whether it is good or bad. You continue this process until Git has found the first bad commit.

Here's a visual representation of how Git bisect works:

<img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/61c02e339c11997e6926e3d9/61c2e4677f5ad2ee55805a1b_5ec962b2f56b09d50c4e0e7b_Screen%2520Shot%25202020-05-21%2520at%252018.13.12-p-1080.png" alt="Git bisect visual representation" width="500" height="300">

As you can see, Git bisect works by dividing the commit history in half with each step, effectively narrowing down the search for the first bad commit.

Once Git has found the first bad commit, you can use `git bisect reset` to return to the original state of your repository.

Git bisect is a powerful tool that can save you a lot of time and effort when debugging your code. Give it a try and see how it works for you!
